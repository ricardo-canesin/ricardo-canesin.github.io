## Theses

- <a href="/images/theses/Master.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>On the bounded derived category of a Dynkin quiver</strong></a>.  
    In my Master's thesis, written under the supervision of [Baptiste Rognerud](https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~baptiste.rognerud/), I studied some techniques from the representation theory of finite-dimensional associative algebras. It covers Gabriel's theorem on representation-finite hereditary algebras and an introduction to Auslander–Reiten theory. The final chapter proves that the bounded derived category of a Dynkin quiver is fractionally Calabi–Yau, following an argument given in the appendix of the preprint [arXiv:2012.11927](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11927).

- <a href="/images/theses/Bachelor.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Modular representations of finite groups</strong></a> (in Portuguese).  
    In my Bachelors's thesis, written under the supervision of [Lucia Satie Ikemoto Murakami](https://www.ime.usp.br/ikemoto/) and [Vitor de Oliveira Ferreira](https://www.ime.usp.br/vofer/), I give an introduction to the theory of modular representations of finite groups. It follows J. Alperin's book "Local representation theory", explaining its results in more detail and giving solutions to all its exercises.
